==  NetCDF Files and Components 

The components of a netCDF file are described in section 2 of the NUG <<NUG>>.
In this section we describe conventions associated with filenames and the basic components of a netCDF file.
We also introduce new attributes for describing the contents of a file.

=== Filename

NetCDF files should have the file name extension "**`.nc`**".

=== Data Types

// TODO: Check, should this be a bullet list?
Data variables must be one of the following data types: **`string`**, **`char`**, **`byte`**, **`unsigned byte`**, **`short`**, **`unsigned short`**, **`int`**, **`unsigned int`**, **`int64`**, **`unsigned int64`**, **`float`** or **`real`**, and **`double`** (which are all the link:$$https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/nug/current/md_types.html$$[netCDF external data types] supported by netCDF-4).
The **`string`** type is only available in files using the netCDF version 4 (netCDF-4) format.
The **`char`** and **`string`** types are not intended for numeric data.
One byte numeric data should be stored using the **`byte`** or **`unsigned byte`** data types.
It is possible to treat the **`byte`** and **`short`** types as unsigned by using the NUG convention of indicating the unsigned range using the **`valid_min`**, **`valid_max`**, or **`valid_range`** attributes.
In many situations, any integer type may be used.
When the phrase "integer type" is used in this document, it should be understood to mean **`byte`**, **`unsigned byte`**, **`short`**, **`unsigned short`**, **`int`**, **`unsigned int`**, **`int64`**, or **`unsigned int64`**.

Strings in variables may be represented one of two ways - as atomic strings or as character arrays.
An n-dimensional array of strings may be implemented as a variable of type **`string`** with n dimensions, or as a variable of type **`char`** with n+1 dimensions where the last (most rapidly varying) dimension is large enough to contain the longest string in the variable.
For example, a character array variable of strings containing the names of the months would be dimensioned (12,9) in order to accommodate "September", the month with the longest name.
The other strings, such as "May", should be padded with trailing NULL or space characters so that every array element is filled.
If the atomic string option is chosen, each element of the variable can be assigned a string with a different length.
The CDL example below shows one variable of each type.

    str_variable:long_name = "strings of type string" ;

The examples in this document that use string-valued variables alternate between these two forms.

=== Naming Conventions

Variable, dimension, attribute and group names should begin with a letter and be composed of letters, digits, and underscores.
By the word _letters_ we mean the standard ASCII letters uppercase `A` to `Z` and lowercase `a` to `z`.
By the word _digits_ we mean the standard ASCII digits `0` to `9`, and similarly _underscores_ means the standard ASCII underscore `_`.
Note that this is in conformance with the COARDS conventions, but is more restrictive than the netCDF interface which allows almost all Unicode characters encoded as multibyte UTF-8 characters (link:$$https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/nug/current/file_format_specifications.html$$[NUG Appendix B]).
The netCDF interface also allows leading underscores in names, but the NUG states that this is reserved for system use.
ASCII period (.) and ASCII hyphen (-) are also allowed in attribute names only.

Case is significant in netCDF names, but it is recommended that names should not be distinguished purely by case, i.e., if case is disregarded, no two names should be the same.
It is also recommended that names should be obviously meaningful, if possible, as this renders the file more effectively self-describing.

This convention does not standardize any variable or dimension names.
Attribute names and their contents, where standardized, are given in English in this document and should appear in English in conforming netCDF files for the sake of portability.
Languages other than English are permitted for variables, dimensions, and non-standardized attributes.
The content of some standardized attributes are string values that are not standardized, and thus are not required to be in English.
For example, a description of what a variable represents may be given in a non-English language using the **`long_name`** attribute (see <<long-name>>) whose contents are not standardized, but a description given by the **`standard_name`** attribute (see <<standard-name>>) must be taken from the standard name table which is in English.

[[dimensions]]
=== Dimensions

A variable may have any number of dimensions, including zero, and the dimensions must all have different names.
__COARDS strongly recommends limiting the number of dimensions to four, but we wish to allow greater flexibility__.
The dimensions of the variable define the axes of the quantity it contains.
Dimensions other than those of space and time may be included.
Several examples can be found in this document.
Under certain circumstances, one may need more than one dimension in a particular quantity.
For instance, a variable containing a two-dimensional probability density function might correlate the temperature at two different vertical levels, and hence would have temperature on both axes.

If any or all of the dimensions of a variable have the interpretations of "date or time" (**`T`**), "height or depth" (**`Z`**), "latitude" (**`Y`**), or "longitude" (**`X`**) then we recommend, but do not require (see <<coards-relationship>>), those dimensions to appear in the relative order **`T`**, then **`Z`**, then **`Y`**, then **`X`** in the CDL definition corresponding to the file.
All other dimensions should, whenever possible, be placed to the left of the spatiotemporal dimensions.

Dimensions may be of any size, including unity.
When a single value of some coordinate applies to all the values in a variable, the recommended means of attaching this information to the variable is by use of a dimension of size unity with a one-element coordinate variable.
It is also acceptable to use a scalar coordinate variable which eliminates the need for an associated size one dimension in the data variable.
The advantage of using either a coordinate variable or an auxiliary coordinate variable is that all its attributes can be used to describe the single-valued quantity, including boundaries.
For example, a variable containing data for temperature at 1.5 m above the ground has a single-valued coordinate supplying a height of 1.5 m, and a time-mean quantity has a single-valued time coordinate with an associated boundary variable to record the start and end of the averaging period.

[[variables]]
=== Variables

This convention does not standardize variable names.

NetCDF variables that contain coordinate data are referred to as __coordinate variables__, __auxiliary coordinate variables__, __scalar coordinate variables__, or __multidimensional coordinate variables__.

[[missing-data, Section 2.5.1, "Missing data, valid and actual range of data"]]
==== Missing data, valid and actual range of data

The NUG conventions
(link:$$https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/attribute_conventions.html$$[NUG Appendix A, Attribute Conventions])
provide the **`_FillValue`**, **`missing_value`**, **`valid_min`**, **`valid_max`**, and **`valid_range`** attributes to indicate missing data.
Missing data is allowed in data variables and auxiliary coordinate variables.
Generic applications should treat the data as missing where any auxiliary coordinate variables have missing values; special-purpose applications might be able to make use of the data.
Missing data is not allowed in coordinate variables.

The NUG conventions for missing data changed significantly between version 2.3 and version 2.4.
Since version 2.4 the NUG defines missing data as all values outside of the **`valid_range`**, and specifies how the **`valid_range`** should be defined from the **`_FillValue`** (which has library specified default values) if it hasn't been explicitly specified.
If only one missing value is needed for a variable then we recommend  that this value be specified using the **`_FillValue`** attribute.
Doing this guarantees that the missing value will be recognized by generic applications that follow either the before or after version 2.4 conventions.

The scalar attribute with the name **`_FillValue`** and of the same type as its variable is recognized by the netCDF library as the value used to pre-fill disk space allocated to the variable.
This value is considered to be a special value that indicates undefined or missing data, and is returned when reading values that were not written.
The **`_FillValue`** should be outside the range specified by **`valid_range`** (if used) for a variable.
The netCDF library defines a default fill value for each data type (See the "Note on fill values" in link:$$https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/file_format_specifications.html#classic_format_spec$$[NUG Appendix B, File Format Specifications]).

The missing values of a variable with **`scale_factor`** and/or **`add_offset`** attributes (see <<packed-data>>) are interpreted relative to the variable's external values (a.k.a. the packed values, the raw values, the values stored in the netCDF file), not the values that result after the scale and offset are applied.
Applications that process variables that have attributes to indicate both a transformation (via a scale and/or offset) and missing values should first check that a data value is valid, and then apply the transformation.
Note that values that are identified as missing should not be transformed.
Since the missing value is outside the valid range it is possible that applying a transformation to it could result in an invalid operation.
For example, the default **`_FillValue`** is very close to the maximum representable value of IEEE single precision floats, and multiplying it by 100 produces an "Infinity" (using single precision arithmetic).

This convention defines a two-element vector attribute **`actual_range`** for variables containing numeric data.
If the variable is packed using the **`scale_factor`** and **`add_offset`** attributes (see <<packed-data>>), the elements of the **`actual_range`** should have the type intended for the unpacked data.
The elements of **`actual_range`** must be exactly equal to the minimum and the maximum data values which occur in the variable (when unpacked if packing is used), and both must be within the **`valid_range`** if specified.
If the data is all missing or invalid, the **`actual_range`** attribute cannot be used.

=== Attributes

This standard describes many attributes (some mandatory, others optional), but a file may also contain non-standard attributes.
Such attributes do not represent a violation of this standard.
Application programs should ignore attributes that they do not recognise or which are irrelevant for their purposes.
Conventional attribute names should be used wherever applicable.
Non-standard names should be as meaningful as possible.
Before introducing an attribute, consideration should be given to whether the information would be better represented as a variable.
In general, if a proposed attribute requires ancillary data to describe it, is multidimensional, requires any of the defined netCDF dimensions to index its values, or requires a significant amount of storage, a variable should be used instead.
When this standard defines string attributes that may take various prescribed values, the possible values are generally given in lower case.
However, applications programs should not be sensitive to case in these attributes.
Several string attributes are defined by this standard to contain "blank-separated lists".
Consecutive words in such a list are separated by one or more adjacent spaces.
The list may begin and end with any number of spaces.
See <<attribute-appendix>> for a list of attributes described by this standard.

[[identification-of-conventions]]
==== Identification of Conventions

Files that follow this version of the CF Conventions must indicate this by setting the NUG defined global attribute **`Conventions`** to a string value that contains "**`CF-{current-version-as-attribute}`**".
The Conventions version number contained in that string can be used to find the web based versions of this document are from the link:$$https://cfconventions.org/$$[netCDF Conventions web page].
Subsequent versions of the CF Conventions will not make invalid a compliant usage of this or earlier versions of the CF terms and forms.

It is possible for a netCDF file to adhere to more than one set of conventions, even when there is no inheritance relationship among the conventions.
In this case, the value of the Conventions attribute may be a single text string containing a list of the convention names separated by blank space (recommended) or commas (if a convention name contains blanks).
This is the Unidata recommended syntax from NetCDF Users Guide, Appendix A.
If the string contains any commas, it is assumed to be a comma-separated list.

When CF is listed with other conventions, this asserts the same full compliance with CF requirements and interpretations as if CF was the sole convention.
It is the responsibility of the data-writer to ensure that all common metadata is used with consistent meaning between conventions.

The UGRID conventions, which are fully incorporated into the CF conventions, do not need to be included in the **`Conventions`** attribute.  

[[description-of-file-contents, Section 2.6.2, "Description of file contents"]]
==== Description of file contents

The following attributes are intended to provide information about where the data came from and what has been done to it.
This information is mainly for the benefit of human readers.
The attribute values are all character strings.
For readability in ncdump outputs it is recommended to embed newline characters into long strings to break them into lines.
For backwards compatibility with COARDS none of these global attributes is required.

The NUG defines **`title`** and **`history`** to be global attributes.
We wish to allow the newly defined attributes, i.e., **`institution`**, **`source`**, **`references`**, and **`comment`**, to be either global or assigned to individual variables.
When an attribute appears both globally and as a variable attribute, the variable's version has precedence.

**`title`**:: A succinct description of what is in the dataset.

**`institution`**:: Specifies where the original data was produced.

**`source`**:: The method of production of the original data.
If it was model-generated, **`source`** should name the model and its version, as specifically as could be useful.
If it is observational, **`source`** should characterize it (e.g., "**`surface observation`**" or "**`radiosonde`**").

**`history`**:: Provides an audit trail for modifications to the original data.
Well-behaved generic netCDF filters will automatically append their name and the parameters with which they were invoked to the global history attribute of an input netCDF file.
We recommend that each line begin with a timestamp indicating the date and time of day that the program was executed.

**`references`**:: Published or web-based references that describe the data or methods used to produce it.

**`comment`**:: Miscellaneous information about the data or methods used to produce it.

[[external-variables, Section 2.6.3, "External variables"]]
==== External Variables
The global **`external_variables`** attribute is a blank-separated list of the names of variables which are named by attributes in the file but which are not present in the file.
These variables are to be found in other files (called "external files") but CF does not provide conventions for identifying the files concerned.
The only attribute for which CF standardises the use of external variables is **`cell_measures`**.

[[groups, Section 2.7, "Groups"]]
=== Groups

Groups provide a powerful mechanism to structure data hierarchically.
This convention does not standardize group names.
It may be of benefit to name groups in such a way that human readers can interpret them.
However, files that conform to this standard shall not require software to interpret or decode information from group names.
References to out-of-group variable and dimensions shall be found by applying the scoping rules outlined below.

==== Scope

The scoping mechanism is in keeping with the following principal:

[quote, 'https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/groups.html[The NetCDF Data Model: Groups]']
"Dimensions are scoped such that they are visible to all child groups.
For example, you can define a dimension in the root group, and use its dimension id when defining a variable in a sub-group."

Any variable or dimension can be referred to, as long as it can be found with one of the following search strategies:

* Search by absolute path
* Search by relative path
* Search by proximity

These strategies are explained in detail in the following sections.

If any dimension of an out-of-group variable has the same name as a dimension of the referring variable, the two must be the same dimension (i.e. they must have the same netCDF dimension ID).

===== Search by absolute path

A variable or dimension specified with an absolute path (i.e., with a leading slash "/") is at the indicated location relative to the root group, as in a UNIX-style file convention.
For example, a `coordinates` attribute of `/g1/lat` refers to the `lat` variable in group `/g1`.

===== Search by relative path

As in a UNIX-style file convention, a variable or dimension specified with a relative path (i.e., containing a slash but not with a leading slash, e.g. `child/lat`) is at the location obtained by affixing the relative path to the absolute path of the referring attribute.
For example, a `coordinates` attribute of `g1/lat` refers to the `lat` variable in subgroup `g1` of the current (referring) group.
Upward path traversals from the current group are indicated with the UNIX convention.
For example, `../g1/lat` refers to the `lat` variable in the sibling group `g1` of the current (referring) group.

===== Search by proximity

A variable or dimension specified with no path (for example, `lat`) refers to the variable or dimension of that name, if there is one, in the referring group.
If not, the ancestors of the referring group are searched for it, starting from the direct ancestor and proceeding toward the root group, until it is found.

A special case exists for coordinate variables.
Because coordinate variables must share dimensions with the variables that reference them, the ancestor search is executed only until the local apex group is reached.
For coordinate variables that are not found in the referring group or its ancestors, a further strategy is provided, called lateral search.
The lateral search proceeds downwards from the local apex group width-wise through each level of groups until the sought coordinate is found.
The lateral search algorithm may only be used for NUG coordinate variables; it shall not be used for auxiliary coordinate variables.

[NOTE]
====
This use of the lateral search strategy to find them is discouraged.
They are allowed mainly for backwards-compatibility with existing datasets, and may be deprecated in future versions of the standard.
====

==== Application of attributes

The following attributes are optional for non-root groups.
They are allowed in order to provide additional provenance and description of the subsidiary data.
They do not override attributes from parent groups.

* `title`
* `history`

If these attributes are present, they may be applied additively to the parent attributes of the same name.
If a file containing groups is modified, the user or application need only update these attributes in the root group, rather than traversing all groups and updating all attributes that are found with the same name.
In the case of conflicts, the root group attribute takes precedence over per-group instances of these attributes.

The following attributes may only be used in the root group and shall not be duplicated or overridden in child groups:

* `Conventions`
* `external_variables`

Furthermore, per-variable attributes must be attached to the variables to which they refer.
They may not be attached to a group, even if all variables within that group use the same attribute and value.

If attributes are present within groups without being attached to a variable, these attributes apply to the group where they are defined, and to that group's descendants, but not to ancestor or sibling groups.
If a group attribute is defined in a parent group, and one of the child group redefines the same attribute, the definition within the child group applies for the child and all of its descendants.


[[aggregation-variables, Section 2.8, "Aggregation Variables"]]
=== Aggregation Variables

An aggregation is conceptually a single, new variable which has been formed by combining multiple other variables stored in pre-exsiting files, and without copying any of the variables' data. The aggregation provides the utlity of being able to view as a single entity a dataset that has been partioned across multiple files, whilst takin up very little space on disk (as it has no copy of the data). Storing aggregations is useful for data analysis, as it avoids the computational expense of creating the aggregation at the time of analysis; and for archive curation, as the aggregation can act as a metadata-rich archive index.

An __aggregation variable__ does not contain its own data, instead it contains instructions on how to create its data as an aggregation of data from other sources. Any kind of variable (data, coordinate, boundary, cell measure, etc) may be an aggregation variable. 

The implied data of an aggregation variable is called its __aggregated data__. The aggregated data is composed of one or more __fragments__, each of which provides the values for a unique and contiguous part of the aggregated data. Each fragment is contained in a __fragment file__ that is external to the file containing the aggregation variable.

The conventions do not currently offer guidance on how to decide if two or more fragments are aggregatable.

The details of how to encode and decode aggregation variables are given in this section, with examples provided in Appendix <<appendix-aggregation-examples>>.

==== Aggregated Dimensions

An aggregation variable should be a scalar (i.e. it has no dimensions) and the value of its single element is immaterial. It acts as a container for all of the usual attributes that describe the data, with the addition of two special attributes that define the dimensions of the aggregated data (i.e. the _aggregated dimensions_), and provide instructions on how the aggregated data is to be created. The data type of the aggregated data is the same as the data type of the aggregation variable.

The aggregated dimensions must be stored with the aggregation variable's **`aggregated_dimensions`** attribute, and it is the presence of this attribute that identifies the variable as an aggregation variable. The value of the **`aggregated_dimensions`** attribute is a blank separated list of the aggregated dimension names given in the order which matches the dimensions of the aggregated data. If the aggregated data is scalar then the value of the **`aggregated_dimensions`** attribute must be an empty string. The named aggregated dimensions must exist as dimensions in the file containing the aggregation variable.

If another variable is acting as metadata to the aggregation variable, then when they are required to share dimensions (e.g. as is the case for auxiliary coordinate variables) the metadata variable must share the approriate aggregated dimensions instead. In particular, a coordinate variable that shares its name with an aggregated dimension is considered to be part of the aggregated variable's domain.

==== Fragment Array

The fragments are logically organised into a __fragment array__ that is an array with the same number of dimensions as the aggregated data. Each dimension of the fragment array is called a __fragment dimension__, and corresponds to the aggregated dimension with the same relative position in the aggregated data. The size of a fragment dimension is equal to the number of fragments that span its corresponding aggregated dimension, of which there will always be at least one. The fragments must be arranged in the same order defined by their positions in the aggregated data. For instance, this means that the first element in the aggregated data is always to be found within the fragment defined by first element of the fragment array.

It is composed of six fragments arranged in a three-dimensional fragment array with shape (1, 3, 2). In this case, each fragment spans the entirety of the Z dimension, but only a part of the Y-X plane.

====

==== Aggregation Instructions

The definitions of the fragments, and the instructions on how to combine them into the aggregated data, are provided by the **`aggregated_data`** attribute. This attribute takes a string value comprising blank-separated elements of the form "__term: aggregation instruction variable__", where __term__ is a case-sensitive keyword which identifies an aggregation instruction, and __aggregation instruction variable__ is the name of a variable that provides the information for the instruction. The order of elements is not significant.

There are four standardized aggregation instructions, identified by the `file`, `address`, `format` and `shape` terms, all of which are mandatory:

*file*

The string-valued file aggregation instruction variable defines how to find each fragment file. In general it has the same shape as the fragment array, and its values specify the fragment file names. Each file name must be either a fully qualified Uniform Resource Identifier (URI, i.e. one that starts with `file://`, `http://`, `s3://`, etc.), or else a file path that is relative to the current location of the aggregation file.

Multiple versions of a fragment, each of which contains equivalent information, may be provided if an extra trailing dimension is included in the aggregation instruction variable. This is useful in the case that various locations are possible for the fragment, but is it not known which of them will exist in the future. An application program may choose to use any version that it has access to. For instance, this feature could be used to define locally and remotely stored versions of a fragment, allowing an application program to only access the remote version if the local version does not exist. If a fragment has fewer versions than others, then its trailing dimension must be padded with missing values.

To assist in fragment file management, any value may contain any number of string substitutions, each of which is defined by the aggregation instruction variable's **`substitutions`** attribute. The use of substitutions can save space in the file; and in the event that the fragment files are moved from their original locations, it may be possible for the new locations to be defined by changing the **`substitutions`** attribute, rather than by changing the fragment file names themselves. The **`substitutions`** attribute takes a string value comprising blank-separated elements of the form "__base: substitution__", where __base__ is a case-sensitive keyword that defines the part of a fragment file name which is to be replaced by the string defined by __substitution__ prior to locating and reading the fragment file. The order of elements is not significant. The value of `base` must have the form `${\...}`, where `\...` represents any characters. For instance, a fragment file name of `\file://data/store/file.nc` could be stored as `"${cache}/file.nc"`, with a **`substitutions`** attribute of `"${cache}: \file://data/store"`.

*address*

The address aggregation instruction variable defines how to find the fragments within the fragment files. In general it has the same shape as the file aggregation instruction variable, and must contain a value for each fragment. However, if the address aggregation  instruction variable is a scalar, then its single value is assumed to apply to all fragments. For a CF-netCDF fragment file, the address is the fragment's netCDF variable name.
    
*format*

The string-valued format aggregation instruction variable defines the format of the fragment files. In general it has the same shape as the file aggregation instruction variable, and must contain a value for each fragment. However, if the `format` aggregation instruction variable is a scalar, then its single value is assumed to apply to all fragments. The format of a CF-netCDF fragment file is stored with the value `nc`.
    
*shape*

The integer-valued shape aggregation instruction variable defines the shape of each fragment's data. In general, the variable is two-dimensional, with the size of the first dimension (i.e. the number of rows) being the number of fragment dimensions, and the size of the second dimension (i.e. the number of columns) being the size of the largest fragment dimension. Each row of values provides the sizes of the fragments along that dimension in the fragment array. When the aggregated data is a scalar there are no aggregated dimensions, and the shape aggregation instruction variable variable must be one-dimensional, of size one, and contain the value 1.

In addition to the standardized terms, any amount of non-standardized terms are also allowed, on the understanding that an application program may choose to ignore any terms that it does not understand, or which are irrelevant for its purpose. Use cases for non-standardized terms could be:

* To provide extra aggregation instructions that enable the aggregation of fragments stored in a file format for which the address aggregation instruction variable alone is insufficient to find the fragments within the fragment files.

* To store metadata that relate to the fragments, but which are not necessary for the creation of the aggregated data. For instance, it may be convenient for a global attribute that is common to each CF-netCDF fragment file to be made available to the aggregated variable, without having to open and inspect the fragment files themselves.

==== Fragment Interpretation

If a fragment file is compressed, by any means, then it must be uncompressed by an application program prior to a fragment's data being used within the aggregated data. It is recommended that the aggregation variable itself is defined without any compression (such as packing, gathering, etc.), since if it were then an uncompressed fragment data would have to represent the compressed values of the aggregated data.

An uncompressed fragmentAll other features relate to uncompressed fragments. 

* A fragment's data, in its entirety, must provide the values for a unique, contiguous part of the aggregated data.

* A fragment's data must either have the same number of dimensions as the aggregated data, or else fewer if any size 1 fragment data dimensions are omitted.

* Each dimension of a fragment's data must correspond uniquely to an aggregated dimension, and be in the same relative order.

* Each dimension of a fragment's data must have the same sense of directionality (i.e. the sense in which it increasing in physical space) as its corresponding aggregated dimension.

* A fragment must have the same data type as the aggregated data.

* A fragment must have equivalent, but not neccesarily identical, units to the aggregated variable. 

An application program is also expected to apply the following operations prior to a fragment's data being used within the aggregated data:

* Any omitted size 1 dimensions must be reinstated.

* If necessary, a fragment's data must be converted to have the aggregated variable's units.

* Missing values in the fragment's data must be changed to values that the aggregation variable recognises as missing. (It is up to the creator of the aggregation variable to ensure all non-missing values in a fragment are not equal to any missing values of the aggregated data.)
